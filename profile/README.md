# GelbEinhalb Minecraft
Welcome to my collection of *mostly* **unmaintained** Minecraft plugins, datapacks, and mods that I've written over the years. 

I'm revisiting each project before making the code public, with the hope that they might be useful to some. These projects are incomplete and not ready for production environments, so please use them with caution. 

While they are not actively maintained, they might still serve as a starting point or temporary solution for your needs. Feel free to fork and contribute if you find something interesting.

> [!NOTE]
> All plugins, datapacks and mods are written for Minecraft Java edition!
